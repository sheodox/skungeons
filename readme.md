# Skungeons :cloud:

Dungeons way up in the sky, woo! Dungeons up in the sky in Minecraft! Build your way up to a Skungeon to challenge the monsters inside and get a bunch of materials!

Skungeons come in several different tiers, requiring you to kill different kind of monsters as well as get different types of reward. They're identifiable by the color of their walls.

* **Wood** - brown walls, fight zombies
* **Iron** - gray walls, fight skeletons
* **Gold** - yellow walls, fight zombie pig men
* **Diamond** - green walls, fight blazes

## Why?

I thought it would be interesting to find a way to liven up resource collection instead of spending countless hours mining.
 Skungeons offer you a challenging way to get resources that forces you to solve the logistical problem of getting to each floating
 dungeon and gives you plenty of resources to make it worthwhile so you can spend more time building and adventuring.
